  # I found by hand that on frame 29 and on frame 80 there is a weird vertical and horizontal pattern
  # Checking first couple of thousands frames those frames would've repeat with same frequency: 103 and 101 times rispectively
  # Having found no reasonable christmas tree yet the idea is to match those vertical and horizontal frames
  # To do that i've to find A and B to solve this equation 30+103A=81+101B with A and B integer
  # Clearly we have an equation with 2 incognites so there will be a family of solution (cycling every 101*103 frames), I've to find the first one
  # To do that i just isolate an incognite (A) and work on the rest A=(51+101B)/103
  # At this point I've to solve for any B that will give me an integer, so using modular arithmetic
  # New equation is 51+101B=0 mod(103) at this point so 101B=-51 (mod 103) so 101B=52 mod(103)
  # At this point i've to divide by 101 but in modular arithmetic is not that simple, so it became B=52 * 101^-1 mod(103)
  # To find modular inverse of 101 mod 3 we use extended euclidean algorithm that find the coefficient of bezout identity
  # Which are the integers x and y such that ax+by=gcd(a,b), the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously satisfy equation and divide the inputs
  # in our case k*101 + m*103=gcd(103,101) and we solve for k=51, m=-50
  # So from B=52*101^-1 mod 103 we have B=52*52 mod 103 that is 77
  # our final formula will be 77*101 (the cycle) + 81 (the starting offset)
  # I know it's not in code but that's what i had to do here
